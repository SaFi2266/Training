          <li>
            <span>1912</span> - Alan Mathison Turing born in Maida Vale, London,
            to Ethel Sara Turere's timeline of ing (nee Stoney) and Julius
            Mathison Turing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1918</span> - Alan joins St Michael's day school in Hastings,

            chess.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1926</span> - Alan becomes a pupil at Sherborne School in
            Dorset. Alan is not interested in their traditional classical
            education as he really wants to spend his time doing Science and
            Mathematics
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1927</span> - Alan becomes deeply interested in the work of
            Albert Einstein and is able to develop work done by Einstein based
            on a questioning of Newton's Laws of Motion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1928-1930</span> Alan enters 6th form at Sherborne and becomes
            great friends with Christopher Morcom, another talented boy who
            loves Maths and Science. While they are applying for university,
            Christopher suddenly dies. Alan is devastated.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1931-1934</span> Alan becomes an undergraduate at King's
            College, Cambridge to study Mathematics. He enjoys university and is
            highly successful. He graduates with distinction.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1935</span> - Alan's work is so distinguished that he is
            elected Fellow of King's College, aged only 23.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1938</span> - Alan goes to Princeton University in America to
            study mathematics and is awarded a PhD.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1939</span> - September - Alan is asked to join the Government
            Codes and Ciphers School and arrives at Bletchley Park the day after
            war is declared.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1939-1940</span> With Gordon Welchman, Alan develops the
            Bombe, a device for decrypting the messages sent by the Germans
            using their Enigma machine.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1940-1942</span> During 1942, Alan and his colleagues also
            manage to break the more complicated German Naval Enigma system.
            This is a tremendous help to the Allies in the Battle of the
            Atlantic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1943-1945</span> Alan is asked to work as a top level

            cryptology (code-breaking).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1945</span> - At the end of the war, Alan Turing is awarded

          <li>
            <span>1950</span> - Alan publishes'Computing Machinery and
            Intelligence' in which he develops the Turing Test, an attempt to
            define a standard for a machine to be called intelligent. The paper
            will become very famous.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1951</span> - During his year, Alan is elected Fellow of the

            <span>1952</span> - January - Alan is arrested for gross indecency
            and loses his security clearance. He is offered chemical treatment
            as an alternative to imprisonment. The hormone treatment has a very

            It is atrocious that we don't recognize this man and the only way to
            do so is to apologize to him. This man was a national treasure and
            we hounded him to his death... I'm looking for an apology from the
            British government because that's where I think the wrong was done.
            But Turing is clearly someone of international stature.
